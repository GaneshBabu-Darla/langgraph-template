# LangGraph Simple Graph Example 🧩

This repository demonstrates a **Simple Graph** implementation using **LangGraph**.

The goal of this example is to clearly explain the **core building blocks of LangGraph**:
- State
- Node
- Edge

using a very simple and predictable workflow.

## 📌 Problem Statement

> “I am planning to play Cricket.”

This workflow does **not** involve:
- Decision making
- Conditional routing
- Loops or retries

It follows a **fixed, linear execution path**.
